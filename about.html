<p>Currently a data analyst at Outplay Entertainment, a leading casual game
studio I analyse game event data, research machine learning techniques,
design A/B tests, and contribute to the implementation of the analytics
infrastructure.</p>

<p>Previously achieved a PhD in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) at the
University of Dundee. My thesis explored reasons why older adults are less
likely to use social networking sites. A mixed-methods approach was used to
firstly derive recommendations for designers of such sites, and secondly, to
demonstrate the success of these recommendations on a working replica of
Facebook. <a href='http://cnorval.com/publications/' target='_blank'>A list of
publications from my PhD can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>My professional interests include advancing my skills with the R programming
 language, experimenting with machine learning techniques, experimental study
 design, and understanding user behaviour.</p>
