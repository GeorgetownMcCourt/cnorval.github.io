<p align="justify">Currently a data analyst at Outplay Entertainment, a leading
mobile game studio focusing on casual and mid-core games. I analyse game event
data, research machine learning techniques, design A/B tests, and contribute to
the implementation of the analytics infrastructure.</p>

<p align="justify">Previously I achieved a PhD in Human Computer Interaction
(HCI) at the University of Dundee. My thesis explored reasons why older adults
are less likely to use social networking sites. A mixed-methods approach was
used to firstly derive recommendations for designers of such sites, and
secondly, to demonstrate the success of these recommendations on a working
replica of Facebook. <a href='http://cnorval.com/publications/' target='_blank'>
A list of publications from my PhD can be found here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">My professional interests include advancing my skills with R
programming, experimenting with machine learning techniques, experimental study
design, and understanding user behaviour.</p>
